		    <p> {{ book.id == id }} I find these debates about reading as enjoyably incensing as anyone â€“ and, just to be clear, I deplore the restrictions placed on prisoners' access to books, which seems less of a storm in a teacup and more of a violation of basic human rights. However, taken alongside the general hum of social networks, book groups, the media-shopping complex and the literary festival season now upon us, I mistrust my own eagerness to engage with this sort of stuff. It is a very good way not to get any reading done.
